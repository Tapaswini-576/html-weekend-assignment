            People experience different symptoms, depending on the allergen and where it enters the body. Allergic reactions can involve many
parts of the body at the same time.
Nose, eyes, sinuses and throat
When allergens are breathed in, the release of histamine causes the lining of the nose to produce more mucus and become swollen
and inflamed. It causes the nose to run and itch, and violent sneezing may occur. Eyes may start to water and people may get a sore
throat.
Lungs and chest
Asthma can be triggered during an allergic reaction. When an allergen is breathed in, the lining of the passages in the lungs swells and
makes breathing difficult.
Stomach and bowel
Foods that commonly cause allergy include peanuts, seafood, dairy products and eggs. Cow's milk allergy in infants may occur and can
cause eczema, asthma, colic and stomach upset. Some people cannot digest lactose (milk sugar). Lactose intolerance causes stomach
upsets, but should not be confused with allergy.
Skin
Skin problems that can be triggered by allergy include atopic dermatitis (eczema) and urticaria (hives).
