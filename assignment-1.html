    <p>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the most basic building block of the Web. It defines the meaning and structure of web content. When you create a web page, you use HTML to structure its content. For example, you can organize content within paragraphs, lists, images, and data tables
        If one species is resistant to certain infection and the other species is susceptible to the same infection 
then it is called as species immunity.
Anatomic, physiological and metabolic differences between species determine species immunity. For 
example, Birds are resistant to anthrax but Human are susceptible. It is simply because higher body 
temperature of birds kills Bacillus anthracis.
Anatomic differences between species also determine species immunity. For example, Human are more 
susceptible to skin infection whereas Cattles are more resistant to the same skin infection. It is because 
of tough and hairy skin (hides) of Cattles.

        <p>The cell cycle is a fundamental process that occurs in all somatic cells, involving a series of events leading to cell division. Let’s explore its key stages:

            Interphase:
            G1 (Gap 1) Phase: During G1, the cell grows, copies organelles, and prepares molecular building blocks for later steps.
            S (Synthesis) Phase: In S phase, the cell synthesizes a complete copy of its DNA and duplicates the centrosome (which helps separate DNA during M phase).
            G2 (Gap 2) Phase: In G2, the cell continues to grow, produces proteins and organelles, and reorganizes its contents for mitosis.
            Mitotic (M) Phase:
            Mitosis: The cell separates its duplicated DNA into two sets, forming two identical daughter cells.
            Cytokinesis: The cell divides its cytoplasm, resulting in two new cells.
            Remember that the cell cycle is a cycle, allowing daughter cells to start the process anew after each division. Animal and plant cells follow similar principles, 
            with additional phases like G0 (a resting state) and G1 checkpoint ensuring proper progression. </p>
